Can we do NBA style heatmaps for primary, secondary, and tertiary colors for each type of pokemon? Perhaps bug types have colors like leaf green and bright yellow, can we see that on a hex-tile?\nHow are colors even represented numerically? I’m familiar with RGB type scales, which are essentially three-dimensional numerical representtions of colors right? Well, in trying to graph this relationship I’ve learned about LUV values which is kind of another 3 number approach to describing colors. HSV values are another three dimensional numerical representation of colors (hue, 360 wheel, 0 red, green 120, blue 240), saturation (0 gray, 100 pure color), value (brightness - 0 black, 100 full brightness).\nBasically, Hex is RGB, just using a hexadecimal system. #RRGGBB, going from OO to FF in terms of intensity for 0-255 values for each color.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/21490210/how-to-plot-a-colour-wheel-by-using-ggplot - This was a helpful article as I was starting to think about how to plot things on a color wheel, but ultimately the help documentation regarding the scale_color_identity function was what guided my approach.\nI’m imagining visualization kind of like some folks they do population density maps with 3D peaks for dense areas that kind of make mountain maps, but instead of a spatial map of a city, we just have a color wheel, and the heights of various colors are based on the frequency of that color’s appearance in the pokemon world (or in the given type).\nTo do this, I would need a few things - first a way to map out radially and assign colors to points/locations, next I would need a way to modify points of heights, or potentially to only display points that are present?\nGoogling is tricky for this! “mapping/graphing colors” type queries result in stuff about how to generally use color in the tidyverse, not how to actually visualize colors themselves.\nIt seems like this code basically generates it:\n\nr  &lt;- seq(0,1,length=201)\nth &lt;- seq(0,2*pi, length=201)\nd  &lt;- expand.grid(r=r,th=th)\ngg &lt;- with(d,data.frame(d,x=r*sin(th),y=r*cos(th),\n                        z=hcl(h=360*th/(2*pi),c=100*r, l=65)))\nggplot(gg) +\n  geom_point(aes(x,y, color=z), size=3)+\n  scale_color_identity()+\n  labs(x=\"\",y=\"\") +\n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how to map out specific colors?\nLooking at the help documentation for scale_color_identity seems to provide some examples.\n\nI think this could kind of work? Each graph could be a type, and each point could be a pokemon’s primary color. Some tricky things I had to figure out - how to convert colors from HEX to RGB to LUV - it ended up simple, but I learned about trying to use non-vectorized functions in mutate, which doesn’t go well!\n\n#Figuring out the basics of the conversion function\ntest0 &lt;- col2rgb(\"#abcdef\")\ntest1 &lt;- col2rgb(\"#abcdef\")[2]\n\n#my approach before I had co-pilot help me clean things up! \n# pokemon_df_rgb &lt;- pokemon_df |&gt; mutate(\n#   red = map_dbl(color_1, ~ col2rgb(.x)[1]), \n#   green = map_dbl(color_1, ~ col2rgb(.x)[2]), \n#   blue = map_dbl(color_1, ~ col2rgb(.x)[3]),\n#   red2 = map_dbl(color_2, ~ col2rgb(.x)[1]), \n#   green2 = map_dbl(color_2, ~ col2rgb(.x)[2]), \n#   blue2 = map_dbl(color_2, ~ col2rgb(.x)[3]),\n#   red3 = map_dbl(color_3, ~ col2rgb(.x)[1]), \n#   green3 = map_dbl(color_3, ~ col2rgb(.x)[2]), \n#   blue3 = map_dbl(color_3, ~ col2rgb(.x)[3])\n# ) \n# \n# # matrixify things\n# rgb_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(pokemon_df_rgb %&gt;% select(red, green, blue) / 255)\n# rgb_matrix2 &lt;- as.matrix(pokemon_df_rgb %&gt;% select(red2, green2, blue2) / 255)\n# rgb_matrix3 &lt;- as.matrix(pokemon_df_rgb %&gt;% select(red3, green3, blue3) / 255)\n# \n# # convert RGB to Luv\n# luv_values &lt;- convertColor(rgb_matrix, from = \"sRGB\", to = \"Luv\")\n# luv_values2 &lt;- convertColor(rgb_matrix2, from = \"sRGB\", to = \"Luv\")\n# luv_values3 &lt;- convertColor(rgb_matrix3, from = \"sRGB\", to = \"Luv\")\n# \n# # Add LUV values to the dataframe\n# pokemon_df_rgb &lt;- pokemon_df_rgb %&gt;%\n#   mutate(\n#     L = luv_values[, 1],\n#     u = luv_values[, 2],\n#     v = luv_values[, 3]\n#   )\n# \n# pokemon_df_rgb &lt;- pokemon_df_rgb %&gt;%\n#   mutate(\n#     L2 = luv_values2[, 1],\n#     u2 = luv_values2[, 2],\n#     v2 = luv_values2[, 3]\n#   )\n# \n# pokemon_df_rgb &lt;- pokemon_df_rgb %&gt;%\n#   mutate(\n#     L3 = luv_values3[, 1],\n#     u3 = luv_values3[, 2],\n#     v3 = luv_values3[, 3]\n#   )\n# \n# ggplot(pokemon_df_rgb, aes(x=u, y=v)) +\n#   geom_point(aes(colour=color_1, size = 2)) +\n#   scale_color_identity() +\n#   coord_fixed()\n# \n# ggplot(pokemon_df_rgb, aes(x=u2, y=v2)) +\n#   geom_point(aes(colour=color_1, size = 2)) +\n#   scale_color_identity() +\n#   coord_fixed()\n# \n# ggplot(pokemon_df_rgb, aes(x=u3, y=v3)) +\n#   geom_point(aes(colour=color_1, size = 2)) +\n#   scale_color_identity() +\n#   coord_fixed()\n\n# Function to extract and normalize RGB values and convert to Luv\nextract_and_convert &lt;- function(df, color_col) {\n  rgb_matrix &lt;- df %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      red = map_dbl(.data[[color_col]], ~ ifelse(is.na(.x), NA, col2rgb(.x)[1])), \n      green = map_dbl(.data[[color_col]], ~ ifelse(is.na(.x), NA, col2rgb(.x)[2])),\n      blue = map_dbl(.data[[color_col]], ~ ifelse(is.na(.x), NA, col2rgb(.x)[3]))\n    ) %&gt;%\n    select(red, green, blue) %&gt;%\n    as.matrix() / 255\n  \n  # Handle NA values in the RGB matrix\n  rgb_matrix[is.na(rgb_matrix)] &lt;- 0\n  \n  luv_values &lt;- convertColor(rgb_matrix, from = \"sRGB\", to = \"Luv\")\n  \n  # Restore NA values in the Luv matrix - copilot basically did this for me. \n  luv_values[rowSums(rgb_matrix == 0) == 3, ] &lt;- NA\n  \n  return(luv_values)\n}\n\n# extract and convert colors\nluv_values1 &lt;- extract_and_convert(pokemon_df, \"color_1\")\nluv_values2 &lt;- extract_and_convert(pokemon_df, \"color_2\")\nluv_values3 &lt;- extract_and_convert(pokemon_df, \"color_f\")\n\n# add LUV values to the dataset\npokemon_df_rgb &lt;- pokemon_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    L = luv_values1[, 1],\n    u = luv_values1[, 2],\n    v = luv_values1[, 3],\n    L2 = luv_values2[, 1],\n    u2 = luv_values2[, 2],\n    v2 = luv_values2[, 3],\n    L3 = luv_values3[, 1],\n    u3 = luv_values3[, 2],\n    v3 = luv_values3[, 3]\n  )\n\n# Plotting\nplots &lt;- list(\n  ggplot(pokemon_df_rgb, aes(x=u, y=v)) +\n    geom_point(aes(colour=color_1, size = 2)) +\n    scale_color_identity() +\n    coord_fixed(),\n  \n  ggplot(pokemon_df_rgb, aes(x=u2, y=v2)) +\n    geom_point(aes(colour=color_1, size = 2)) +\n    scale_color_identity() +\n    coord_fixed(),\n  \n  ggplot(pokemon_df_rgb, aes(x=u3, y=v3)) +\n    geom_point(aes(colour=color_1, size = 2)) +\n    scale_color_identity() +\n    coord_fixed()\n)\n\n# Print plots\n# for (plot in plots) {\n#   print(plot)\n# }\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(pokemon_df_rgb, aes(x=u3, y=v3)) +\n    geom_point(aes(colour=color_f, text=pokemon)) +\n    scale_color_identity() +\n    coord_fixed() + \n    facet_wrap(vars(type_1)) +\n    theme_gray() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n#make it interactive, like we did in #dataviz24\nggplotly(p1, tooltip=\"text\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Shiny App is below! I wanted to make a dashboard where we could select types and see the colors used for each type of pokemon. It turned out that types basically map 1:1 with colors - all the pokemon of the same type & second type have the same color - for example - all pokemon of type ghost and dragon would have the same “final color”. One issue - I’m not really sure what these colors are even used for in pokemon! And I’ve played pokemon! I was hoping to basically get the actual primary colors of the pokemon images but I think this is some other type of value the game uses.

That said, 80% of three year-olds had been tested at some point in their lives. Perhaps it would make sense to do some sort of rolling cohort type thing (similar to how graduation rates are calculated and compared over time) - e.g. the percentage of 3-year olds who have at any point experienced blood lead levels at or above 3.5 ug/dL - and then compare each age group across years - e.g. 2022 3-years olds v 2023 3-year olds - do we see a decrease in the percentage of children exposed to lead? The reason I think something like this might be superior is that it would give you a greater degree of coverage of the comparison groups (e.g. 80% plus of each group will have been tested) and they will have had the same number of years (3) for potential exposures. That said, it might seem a bit convoluted or hard to explain. \nMeasurement of program effect: Perhaps we could look at the change in the percentage of children exposed following implementation of the 2019 legislative package and compare it to similar cities (or imagined/constructed cities) with similar context (e.g. deep poverty, old housing stock, old school buildings, weather, etc.). It might be tricky if other places have significantly higher or lower testing levels as well - similar to how looking at SAT or AP scores from some states shows artificially inflated numbers due to low participation rates."

Additionally, lead in the soil could be a source of exposure for children. The amount of lead in water from a given outlet is correlated with the future amount of lead in the water from that outlet - barring remediation, we would expect to see similar levels of lead exposure.

    "text": "Legal Context\nState preemption of necessary elements (e.g. Georgia’s ban on local governments establishing registries of rental properties) would likely weaken if not completely nullify the impact of local legislation that may be dependent on something like a rental registry from which to issue rental licenses. In this way it acts as a potential moderator on the treatment in the DAG.\nAdditionally, previous laws may also lay the groundwork for the current legislative package under consideration, and also impact childhood exposure risk in the past and present."

    "text": "Hypotheses\nI predict that the 2019 legislative package will reduce the percentage of children exposed to lead by approximately 20% (e.g. going from 10% of children being exposed lead by the age of five to 8% of children being exposed to lead by the age of five). Given the change in exposure rate (~-6% in 10 years, or a 50% reduction) from 2012 to 2022 - this seems possible (cityofphiladelphia2024?)."

    "text": "Identification strategy\nAlso briefly describe what kinds of threats to internal and external validity you face in your study.\nRCT doesn’t seem feasible - can’t assign laws randomly across jurisdictions.\nRegression discontinuity also doesn’t seem feasible here - we don’t have a clear cutoff applied to treatment (passage of a law) that makes sense.\nIVs - I can’t think of anything that would essentially stand in for a randomizing treatment effect a la malfunctioning submarine torpedos for promotion or special radio towers for Sesame Street.\nWhich leaves me with Differences-in-Differences (DD). I suppose I would look at some nearby cities (e.g. Wilmington, Camden, Baltimore, Newark, New York City) and try to find one (or several) that have similar trends with regards to the percentage of children that had newly identified lead exposures in a given year for the time period leading up to the legislation (pre-2019).\nMy goal is to find a city or couple cities that satisfy the requirements* laid out in the Effect -\n\n“There’s no particular reason to believe the untreated group would suddenly change around the time of treatment.”\n\ne.g. the comparison city should not be enacting similar lead-prevention legislation, or say undertaking a massive atypical residential construction spree\n\nThe treated group and untreated groups are generally similar in many ways.\n\ne.g. the cities should have similar age housing stock, similar levels of industrial and waste exposure in the cities and proximity of residential housing to those risks, similar levels of poverty and rental housing\n\nThe treated group and untreated groups had similar trajectories for the dependent variable before treatment.”\n\ne.g. for the years before the legislation, the other city should also have a downward trend (like Philadelphia) in terms of it’s exposure rate.\n\n\nDD deals with selection bias by saying - one group may have opted to do the treatment - but we are going to make a case that the other group, though they didn’t select the treatment, was very similar to the treatment group - for the reasons noted above - and as such, we think the trend of the control group serves as a useful comparison and predictor for what would’ve happened with the treatment group had the treatment (legislation) not occurred.\nDD isolates the causal outcome by saying (e.g. assuming Camden was a good, similar comparison city) - we are going to create a counterfactual for what would’ve happened in Philadelphia, by looking at the before and after 2019 eras in Camden and comparing the change in lead exposure risk for children there to the change in exposure risk for children in Philadelphia. Because these two cities were so similar and on the same path and Camden did nothing wild during that time period, it is reasonable to attribute the differences in differences between the two cities’ before and after risk levels to the treatment - in this case the 2019 legislative package enacted in Philadelphia."

    "text": "Data\nWe will rely on data captured by local or state governments on city or county level data on childhood exposure risk to lead. Philadelphia’s Department of Health collects this data here. We will measure the percentage of children who are 6-years old who have been exposed to lead one or more times in their life while residing in the city.\nIdeally we would access individual-level data on every test conducted on children by the local government.\nAdditional data we will consider, not for the causal analysis per se, but to make the argument for parallel trends would be information on housing stock trends and legislative changes related to these issues."
