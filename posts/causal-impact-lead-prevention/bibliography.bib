Researchers in this area have made important advances in understanding about the performance of public organizations.

Has it focused unduly on problems of the advanced democracies? Has it made itself irrelevant to public debates about the role and design of government, and the capacity of public institutions to deal with emerging challenges? This set of eight short essays were prepared for a roundtable held at the research conference of the PMR Association at the University of Aarhus in June 2016.

            Although numerous scholars claim the eminent demise of bureaucracy, this article argues that bureaucracy will not only survive in the twenty-first century but will flourish. The core of the argument is that the large-scale tasks that government must perform—national defense, a social welfare system, political monitoring of the economy, etc.—will remain key functions of governments in the twenty-first century and that bureaucracies, likely public but possibly private, will continue to be the most effective way to do these tasks. Bureaucracy has weathered other calls for its demise before; current efforts are likely to meet similar fates. After a brief discussion of definitions and the meaning of bureaucracy, the major sections of this article deal with six challenges to bureaucracy. Some of these challenges are intellectual; others are part of real-world ongoing reform efforts in a variety of countries.},

It rejects output measures and suggests a two‐dimensional framework of using capacity and autonomy as a measure of executive branch quality. This framework explains the conundrum of why low‐income countries are advised to reduce bureaucratic autonomy while high‐income ones seek to increase it.},

In this paper the theoretical arguments on the differences between private firms and public agencies are reviewed, and 13 hypotheses are identified on the impact of publicness on organizational environments, goals, structures and managerial values. Evidence from 34 empirical studies of differences between public agencies and private firms is critically evaluated. Only three of the publicness hypotheses are supported by a majority of the empirical studies: public organizations are more bureaucratic, and public managers are less materialistic and have weaker organizational commitment than their private sector counterparts. However, most of the statistical evidence is derived from studies that use narrow measures of publicness and fail to control for other relevant explanatory variables. Whether the existing evidence understates or overstates the distinctiveness of public agencies is therefore unclear. A research agenda and methods are identified for better comparisons of management in public and private organizations.},

Many empirical studies reveal that electoral democracy has no necessary implications for the establishment of legitimacy. Even in the successful and stable Nordic democracies, there is scant evidence that legitimacy is created on the input side of the political system. For example political legitimacy in the former Yugoslavia broke down not because ethnic groups realized they would become permanent minorities but because the new Croatian state violated citizens’ rights in the exercise of power. Legitimacy turns out to be created, maintained, and destroyed not at the input but at the output side of the political system. Hence, political legitimacy depends at least as much on the quality of government than on the capacity of electoral systems to create effective representation.},

We argue, however, that a key issue has not been addressed, namely, what quality of government (QoG) actually means at the conceptual level. Based on analyses of political theory, we propose a more coherent and specific definition of QoG: the impartiality of institutions that exercise government authority. We relate the idea of impartiality to a series of criticisms stemming from the fields of public administration, public choice, multiculturalism, and feminism. To place the theory of impartiality in a larger context, we then contrast its scope and meaning with that of a threefold set of competing concepts of quality of government: democracy, the rule of law, and efficiency/effectiveness.},

Our results suggest there is a direct effect of good governance on multidimensional poverty and that good governance is associated with reduced horizontal inequalities. However, we find evidence of a beneficial effect of good governance for middle‐income countries but not for low‐income countries.

              This article develops and tests a concise multi‐stage approach for assessing the impact of social construction on the implementation of public programs designed to benefit negatively constructed groups. The framework suggests that negative constructions lead to policy choices that create problems in the implementation process. These problems prevent the accomplishment of key subobjectives necessary for ultimate program success.
            
            
              Methods.
              We test the utility of the framework in an analysis of a key public health issue—the spread of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis in prisons. Despite great strides in the treatment and prevention of these diseases outside prison walls, the incidence and severity of both in the incarcerated population has increased dramatically over the last five years. We hypothesize that the problem of inadequate funding, arising from the negative social construction of this unique target population, is to blame.
            
            
              Results.
              In an analysis of 50 state correctional systems, we find that states with the most negative constructions of criminals and potential criminals spend dramatically less on inmate health, relative to other states.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              Our analysis suggests that inadequate funding levels in states with negative constructions of criminals and potential criminals jeopardizes the implementation of prison programs targeted at the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.},

	abstract = {It is widely argued that increased community participation in government decision making produces many important benefits. Dissent is rare: It is difficult to envision anything but positive outcomes from citizens joining the policy process, collaborating with others and reaching consensus to bring about positive social and environmental change. This article, motivated by contextual problems encountered in a participatory watershed management initiative, reviews the citizen‐participation literature and analyzes key considerations in determining whether community participation is an effective policy‐making tool. We list conditions under which community participation may be costly and ineffective and when it can thrive and produce the greatest gains in effective citizen governance. From the detritus of an unsuccessful citizen‐participation effort, we arrive at a more informed approach to guide policy makers in choosing a decision‐making process that is appropriate for a community's particular needs.},

A range of stakeholder identiﬁcation and analysis techniques is reviewed. The techniques cover: organizing participation; creating ideas for strategic interventions, including problem formulation and solution search; building a winning coalition around proposal development, review and adoption; and implementing, monitoring and evaluating strategic interventions. The article argues that wise use of stakeholder analyses can help frame issues that are solvable in ways that are technically feasible and politically acceptable and that advance the common good.

	abstract = {This study argues that President Obama's strong association with an issue like health care should polarize public opinion by racial attitudes and race. Consistent with that hypothesis, racial attitudes had a significantly larger impact on health care opinions in fall 2009 than they had in cross‐sectional surveys from the past two decades and in panel data collected before Obama became the face of the policy. Moreover, the experiments embedded in one of those reinterview surveys found health care policies were significantly more racialized when attributed to President Obama than they were when these same proposals were framed as President Clinton's 1993 reform efforts. Dozens of media polls from 1993 to 1994 and from 2009 to 2010 are also pooled together to show that with African Americans overwhelmingly supportive of Obama's legislative proposals, the racial divide in health care opinions was 20 percentage points greater in 2009–10 than it was over President Clinton's plan back in 1993–94.},

	abstract = {President Barack Obama came into office with a social welfare policy agenda that aimed to reconstitute what can be understood as the “submerged state”: a conglomeration of existing federal policies that incentivize and subsidize activities engaged in by private actors and individuals. By attempting to restructure the political economy involved in taxation, higher education policy, and health care, Obama ventured into a policy terrain that presents immense obstacles to reform itself and to the public's perception of its success. Over time the submerged state has fostered the profitability of particular industries and induced them to increase their political capacity, which they have exercised in efforts to maintain the status quo. Yet the submerged state simultaneously eludes most ordinary citizens: they have little awareness of its policies or their upwardly redistributive effects, and few are cognizant of what is at stake in reform efforts. This article shows how, in each of the three policy areas, the contours and dynamics of the submerged state have shaped the possibilities for reform and the form it has taken, the politics surrounding it, and its prospects for success. While the Obama Administration won hard-fought legislative accomplishments in each area, political success will continue to depend on how well policy design, policy delivery and political communication reveal policy reforms to citizens, so that they better understand how reforms function and what has been achieved.},

	abstract = {Household income is a measure of income received by the household sector. It includes every form of cash income, e.g., salaries and wages, retirement income, investment income and cash transfers from government. It may include near-cash government transfers like food stamps, and it may be adjusted to include social transfers in-kind, such as the value of publicly provided health care and education.
Household income can be measured on various bases, such as per household, per capita, per earner, or on an equivalised basis. Because the number of people or earners per household can vary significantly between regions and over time, the choice of measurement basis can impact household income rankings and trends.
When taxes and mandatory contributions are subtracted from household income, the result is called net or disposable household income. A region's mean or median net household income can be used as an indicator of the purchasing power or material well-being of its residents. Mean income (average) is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group. Median income is the amount that divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount.},

This includes new and continued relationships with homeless shelters, legal aid clinics, and providing Economic Impact Payment information in more than 35 languages. Check the Status of Your Economic Impact PaymentTo check the status of your Economic Impact Payment, please visit the IRS Get my Payment pageTo check if you qualify for the Economic Impact Payment this round, Were you eligible to receive an Economic Impact Payment in 2020, but never received it?

In 1989, with a million children living in poverty in Canada, members of parliament voted unanimously to eliminate child poverty by the year 2000. By 2013, the rate child poverty in Canada was higher than it was in 1989, and was approaching the poverty rates of the mid-1970s in spite of the growth of Canada's economy between 1981 and 2010. 
As of 2018, the rate of child poverty in Canada was close to the average of other OECD member nations.: 8   
Child poverty has a disproportionately high effect on Indigenous households in Canada. According to a 2019 study by researchers at the Assembly of First Nations and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA), nearly 50\% of Indigenous children in Canada—both on and off reserve—were living in poverty. In 2020, 4.7\% of children under 18 were living in poverty, which was a significant decrease from the 9.7\% child poverty rate in 2019. Other groups that are at a higher risk of experiencing poverty include children living in single-parent households and recent immigrants.},

	abstract = {Objectives. We sought to determine whether health care use and expenditures among gay and bisexual men were reduced following the enactment of samesex marriage laws in Massachusetts in 2003.
Methods. We used quasi-experimental, prospective data from 1211 sexual minority male patients in a community-based health center in Massachusetts.
Results. In the 12 months after the legalization of same-sex marriage, sexual minority men had a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in medical care visits (mean = 5.00 vs mean = 4.67; P = .05; Cohen’s d = 0.17), mental health care visits (mean = 24.72 vs mean = 22.20; P = .03; Cohen’s d = 0.35), and mental health care costs (mean = \$2442.28 vs mean = \$2137.38; P = .01; Cohen’s d = 0.41), compared with the 12 months before the law change. These effects were not modiﬁed by partnership status, indicating that the health effect of same-sex marriage laws was similar for partnered and nonpartnered men.
Conclusions. Policies that confer protections to same-sex couples may be effective in reducing health care use and costs among sexual minority men. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:285–291. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300382)},

If high turnover rates are due to individuals' search for better opportunities, it will affect the implementation primarily through lack of experience and shorter time horizons among civil servants.

“It has been shown that, throughout history, elites have been tempted and have had the opportunity to take advantage of their positions at the expense of society at large” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 13) rich prey on society to their benefit“The main idea in this book is that if the organization of the state apparatus, or the Leviathan in the book’s title, divides public officials into two distinct groups, the possibilities for abuse and opportunism by public officials are diminished because these two groups have different career incentives.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 13) quite divided re philly council staff, for some“By separation of careers, we do not refer to the formal, de jure, divide via, for example, a Civil Service Act, since it is well documented that such laws are often circumvented (Grindle 2012; Schuster 2014). Instead, we think of the de facto separation between the careers of public employees, bureaucrats, and politicians.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 14) culture of separation“civil servants in the United Kingdom and Ireland have not been permitted to be active members of political parties; a similar separation of politicians’ and bureaucrats’ careers is present in countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 14) are they allows to voice personal opinions on political matters, attend protests / rallies, door knock?“Separation of careers is conducive to good government because it generates an embedded system of mutual checks and balances between officials because they are responsive through different channels of accountability (politicians to electors and bureaucrats to their professional peers)” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 15)“strategic decentralization” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 15) what does this look like?“n this chapter, we start a dialog between these two lines of research that have thus far not spoken to one another, despite their study of similar problems.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 16) attempt to marry comp economics / political science \&\& public administration literature on corruption“As most of the comparative literature on corruption and government effectiveness simply ignores the bureaucratic side of the state, this in itself misrepresents reality and can bias conclusions of this literature. Additionally, neglecting the bureaucratic side of the state also increases the risk of deriving the wrong policy implications. And, while the public administration literature has studied political and bureaucratic relations, it puts too much stress on rules and regulations and misses the importance of incentives. Earlier literature developed a specific interpretation of the Weberian legacy, which we question (for earlier critique see Lynn 2001; Svara 1998). Its prediction is that what is often referred to as a closed administration protects the bureaucracy from political influence, which in turn positively affects the quality of government.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 16) critique of isolated approaches in each sphere (comp econ \& public admin)“We follow Evans and Rauch (1999) and are only interested in personnel systems. Within this subcategory we distill two dimensions that do not necessarily coincide (Olsen 2005). The first dimension relates to employment protection and cases tend to cluster in so-called closed and open systems. The second dimension relates to the separation of careers between politicians and bureaucrats, and distinguishes between separated and integrated systems.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 16) from weber - they take:““why nations fail” (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012)” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 17) meh... losing cred!“Socio-economic development is not so much the result of geography, cultural, or religious values, or a large accumulation of natural, human, or social capital, as has conventionally been held, but of good institutions.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 17) complicated assertion“if it is true that historical legacies matter for understanding the hugely diverse fortunes of contemporary countries, this is because the historical experience is transmitted through institutions” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 17) institutions are the mechanism through which historical experience is transmitted onward into the future“So far, the literature has advanced a great deal in operationalizing quality of government and concepts related to good government,” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 18) who has a theory of international impact on QoG?(Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 18) wonder if it's possible to have same benefits of separation if you have a political party culture focused on self-accountability“But, critically, we still do not know which particular features of government explain why some countries are always at the top (or at the bottom) of those rankings. One reason for this shortcoming is probably related to the fact that comparative economics and political science have not sufficiently studied the organization of government.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 18) another question, even if we determine certain organizational features of govt as being crucial to QoG, is how to achieve such organizational features, under what conditions can they flourish(Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 18) how does Eric Adams fit in this model?“The implicit assumption in Acemoglu and Robinson (2012), as well as in most conventional accounts, is that bureaucracies are responsive to their rulers, especially if they are autocrats. Yet, what creates incentives for bureaucrats? To what extent are bureaucrats’ incentives aligned with those of their political masters?” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 19)“Is it not likely that these incentives may play an important role in explaining differences in quality of government?” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 19) pointing out blindspot of acemoglu“we hope to contribute to the literature by putting bureaucracies on the agenda of comparative politics, where many scholars and other observers have neglected them.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 19) goal of book in part response to fukuyama identified gap“Simply put, the basic idea in the reform suggestions of that time was to untie the overly close bonds between politicians and bureaucrats by introducing civil service reforms. This insight is fundamental for our suggestion; the incentive structure created by separating careers for politicians and bureaucrats was indeed positive for government performance.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 20) thesis“In short, we do not agree that bureaucrats need always be “above politics,” using Gary Miller’s (2000, 289) expression. Miller’s analysis is probably true for the particular context of the American federal government where “there are probably fewer bribes among the two million federal bureaucrats than there are among the 435 members of Congress” (Miller 2000, 316), but is not a universal law.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 21)“We therefore see no reason to a priori think of bureaucrats as better types than politicians, nor as worse types, as sometimes suggested by the public choice literature (Niskanen 1971; Tullock 1965). We take a more pragmatic approach. We think that bureaucrats, or for that matter politicians, are good or bad depending on the organizational structure in which they operate.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 21) take bureaucrats off the pedestal - they can rob just as bad as any politician depending on context“On the other extreme when bureaucracy is extremely autonomous – we have another undesirable situation. Fukuyama (2013) uses Japan and Germany in the first decades of the twentieth century as examples of the perils of polities dominated by well-organized and powerful (mostly military) bureaucracies.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 21) argues inverted u - shape relationship between level of bureaucratic autonomy and QoG (or at least effective and uncorrupt) - how do you get in the middle? how did japan and germany get dominated by bureaucracy? (does it hapepn in situations other than military?)“olity entirely dominated by administrators could have negative effects just as much as one controlled by an unconstrained ruler.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 22)“best outcomes tend to happen where there is an “organizational balancing” between politicians and bureaucrats.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 22)“We differ in three respects from mainstream public administration. First, we note that there is no consensus about a definition of a Weberian bureaucracy, and the definition often used is too broad, according to scholars such as Olsen (2008). As we will return to soon, we use a narrow definition and mainly focus on the recruitment system and the career system created by it. Second, we do not place as much confidence in the rules and regulations of the bureaucracy as is often done. Our approach instead emphasizes incentives for corruption and effectiveness created by career prospects. Finally, we use a broader comparative design than is often used in public administration. Our main objective in the follo” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 23) method differences from traditional public admin investigations of bureaucracy on QoG“Put together, public governance should be seen as a realm with many opportunities for rentseeking that, at the same time, can be easily captured by small factions highly motivated to advance their interests at the expense of social welfare.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 24)“Consider, for example, an infrastructure project. Apart from contributing to social welfare, it produces benefits to the specific community in which the project is located, to contractors and subcontractors, and to workers in construction and maintenance. When they decide on projects like this, politicians have the opportunity to manipulate them in order, for instance, to benefit their cronies.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 24) rebuild to biden's infrastructure bill“Since the moral hazard is a built-in problem for all organizations, there cannot be a definite solution to it. Instead, the goal should be to minimize its consequences by organizing the decision-making process in a way that credibly constrains rulers’ morally hazardous behavior.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 25) corruption is inevitable possibility, but by design we can constrain“suggests that the potentially most problematic decisions should be delegated to external actors, such as a group of autonomous bureaucrats. Similar to Thomas Schelling’s (1960) path-breaking analysis of nuclear deterrence, Miller (2000) considers that the key to success is delegating to someone whose preferences are “known to be different from your own”” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 25) COVID really put this to the test. Trump pushing CDC to rewrite guidance, to support school reopening, Biden getting 3 ft distancing approved, delta continued operation, etc.“We think it is just as important that politicians monitor bureaucrats.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 25) 100\%! We had to stay on the DoL to do enforcement of fair workweek requirements, had to funnel constituents to them! had to help them get the word out. Also hearings on the PPA's attempt to steal back money from the school district due to bs overpayment!“First, the incentives for both public managers and public employees must be geared toward effectiveness and not toward some other goal. There are at least two mechanisms through which incentives originating from different career systems affect government effectiveness. We do not need to go to the extreme case of corruption to find two-way monitoring between politicians and bureaucrats useful. There is probably much wasteful spending in all polities, within the framework of the law, and, if no one dares to speak truth to power, this will be higher than it needs to be.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 26) speaking truth to power important for reducing wasteful spending all around“Second, public employees must be willing to make investments in new reforms if the sector is to approve.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 26) such as what?“That is, if the employment relationship is interrupted, the bureaucrat may not recover her investment and, rationally anticipating this, she may prefer not to invest in expertise in the first place. The ruler needs to convince employees in the public sector to invest in skills needed, which are often specific and therefore less transferable, and to work once they are in a secure position.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 27) basically - there are specific unmarketable skills that are needed by bureaucrats - which if you don't have job protection - aint likely to get trained“For instance, once a manager knows that employees can make 20 pieces a day, she might not keep the initially promised reward of \$10 per piece but rather cut it down.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 27) also much govt work is not making fucking widgets!“For example, one of the most conventional hypotheses in delegation theories is, in fact, that the more political principals, the more difficult the control of bureaucratic agents will be (Bendor, Glazer, and Hammond 2001, 245), that is, a hypothesis that goes in the opposite direction of this book’s.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 28) huh? i thought the book was saying keep them separate, not necessarily reduce number? what is a political principal? elected or appointed official, both?“For instance, Brehm and Gates (1997) consider that to achieve organizational efficiency superiors must take responsibility for the actions they supervise and provide a perception of trustworthiness, treating employees as if they were trustworthy, that is, reducing overall levels of surveillance. In other words, the carrot matters more than the stick in getting public employees to make an extra effort.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 28) i believe this and experienced this“some scholars have argued that the margin of maneuver of employers should be constrained in a way that any promise they make to their employees becomes credible” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 29)“The most obvious way to constrain the margin of maneuver of employers is by dividing the employers into groups.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 29)“We argue that a separation of politicians ́ and bureaucrats ́ careers generates, first, an embedded system of mutual checks and balances between officials, because they are responsive to two different chains of accountability.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 30) jsutification for claim separation more important than rules (incenveitves)“Interestingly enough, the degree of separation of careers also varies dramatically from country to country, sometimes within relatively similar contexts, such as the OECD. For instance, scholars have called attention to the remarkable divergence between “those countries where membership of the ruling party is compulsory for senior civil servants and those where such officials are forbidden to belong to political parties” (Hood 2002, 310” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 30)“She will have very few incentives to check the residual generated by a particular policy” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 31) saw this with CSO and BoE“a bureaucrat loyal to the ruling party will generally not dare to propose an innovative policy” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 32) "generally" doing some work here - bit of an assumption.“integrated career system could both be a consequence of a “politicization” of the bureaucracy” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 33) eg project 2025““bureaucratization” of politics (Aberbach, Putnam, and Rockman 1981, 16).” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 33) what does this look like?“Countries in which civil servants do not face limitations to being active in politics” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 34) what does this look like, just running for office?“Basically the same argument applies to elected officials or political appointees when they discover potentially corrupt behavior in merit-recruited civil servants” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 34) how so?“In other words, creating different lines of accountability enables whistleblowers on either side of the divide to take action against corruption.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 34) unions can play a similar role protecting bureaucratic workers from mgmt level bureaucrats“For instance, the Subdirector General we mentioned before will be more prone to push through a promising, and yet unavoidably uncertain, novel solution, even if it could challenge the minister’s current preferred policy approach.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 35) hesitant about this vague example - what if it's a top down bureaucracy, with little room for innovation not due to other factors - legal concerns, etc. - that might not be present in a separated system““the man who does his duty and, nevertheless, is not sure about his fate”” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 35)““which kind of interest, for example, a provincial administrator will have? Which reforms will he take? Which works will he make when he knows that – because of any reason, intrigue, betrayal or because someone is closer to the minister – he will be dismissed?”” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 35) this is the anti CRT books in schools shit“more flexible “practices and processes applied in the private sector”” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 37) at will firing? for cause? what's the line“where recruitment for the vast majority of positions is based on formalized exams” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 39) closed“In the open bureaucracies to the left, most public employees are selected after a screening process (through their CVs and their performance in job interviews). In contrast, the preferred way of recruiting employees in closed bureaucracies is through signaling. Candidates signal their abilities in a competitive exam or, to be more precise, in a long series of strictly formalized competitive exams.” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 39) open v closed hiring“may increase the risk of the second part by overprotecting civil servants, which may help them into political careers, as in Japan or Spain” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 41) expound?“updated” (Dahlström and Lapuente, 2017, p. 43) undated

	abstract = {Recruiting civil servants on the basis of merit is believed to improve the quality of governance because it increases the bureaucracy's expertise, leads bureaucrats to develop distinct preferences and encourages them to candidly voice their opinions to others. Yet, to date, the reason why merit recruitment positively affects employee voice remains theoretically vague and has received little empirical scrutiny. This article advances this research by theoretically specifying why merit recruitment positively affects employee voice, and by empirically testing this association with survey data measuring the perceptions of federal civil servants in Canada. Controlling for several additional factors believed to influence employee voice, the results from various multivariate regression models show a robust and statistically significant association between merit recruitment and fear to voice a dissenting opinion. The more civil servants believe that merit recruitment is high, the less they fear reprisal for expressing a dissenting opinion to their superiors.

	abstract = {The interaction between political executives and civil servants rests on a delicate balance between political responsiveness and the duty of civil servants and ministers to respect legal and other normative constraints on executive authority. In Danish central government, this balance is stressed by norms that define the correct behavior when the civil service provides ministers with political advice and assistance. Organizational factors strongly influence civil servants' behavior when they have to balance responsiveness against constraints on their role as political advisers. Moreover, civil servants working closely with ministers pay more attention to legal constraints than their peers among agency officials and specialists. Agency officials and specialists are much more prone to prioritize professional standards. We argue that this pattern can be generalized West European systems.},

	abstract = {Bureaucratic behavior in developing countries remains poorly understood. Why do some public servants—yet not others—work hard to deliver public services, misuse state resources, and/or participate in electoral mobilization? A classic answer comes from Weber: Bureaucratic structures shift behavior toward integrity, neutrality, and commitment to public service. Our study conducts the first survey experimental test of the effects of bureaucratic structures. It does so through a conjoint experiment with public servants in the Dominican Republic. Looking at merit examinations and job stability, we find that Weber was right—but only partially. Recruitment by examination curbs corruption and political services by bureaucrats, while enhancing work motivation. Job stability, by contrast, only decreases political services: Tenured bureaucrats are less likely to participate in electoral mobilization. Examinations thus enhance the quality of bureaucracy (motivation and lower corruption) and democracy (electoral competition); job stability only enhances the quality of democracy.},

Empirical evidence on the impact of strategy on performance is placed under the microscope, and while there are many positive relationships, the evidence base is limited in terms of its scope, data, methods, measures, and coverage. The authors trace out what needs to be done to move the field forward, noting in particular that theoretical enrichment, empirical variety, and explanations of causal complexity are likely to come from a synthesis of models of strategy and publicness

	abstract = {Objectives: This study explores the effect of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act on the maternal mortality ratio in the United States.
Methods: A difference-in-differences research design was used to analyze the effect of Medicaid expansion on maternal mortality. Maternal mortality was deﬁned with and without late maternal deaths, to substantiate the contribution of increased preconception and postpartum insurance coverage. To examine whether there was a racial difference in the effects of Medicaid expansion, models were stratiﬁed by the woman’s race/ethnicity for non-Hispanic Black women, non-Hispanic White women, and Hispanic women.
Results: Medicaid expansion was signiﬁcantly associated with lower maternal mortality by 7.01 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births (p ¼ .002) relative to nonexpansion states. When maternal mortality deﬁnitions excluded late maternal deaths, Medicaid expansion was signiﬁcantly associated with a decrease in maternal mortality per 100,000 live births by 6.65 (p ¼ .004) relative to nonexpansion states. Medicaid expansion effects were concentrated among nonHispanic Black mothers, suggesting that expansion could be contributing to decreasing racial disparities in maternal mortality.
Conclusions: Although maternal mortality overall continues to increase in the United States, the maternal mortality ratio among Medicaid expansion states has increased much less compared with nonexpansion states. These results suggest that Medicaid expansion could be contributing to a relative decrease in the maternal mortality ratio in the United States. The decrease in the maternal mortality ratio is greater when maternal mortality estimates include late maternal deaths, suggesting that sustained insurance coverage after childbirth as well as improved preconception coverage could be contributing to decreasing maternal mortality.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades the number of opioid pain relievers sold in the United States rose dramatically. This rise in sales was accompanied by an increase in opioid-related overdose deaths. In response, forty-nine states (all but Missouri) created prescription drug monitoring programs to detect high-risk prescribing and patient behaviors. Our objectives were to determine whether the implementation or particular characteristics of the programs were effective in reducing opioid-related overdose deaths. In adjusted analyses we found that a state’s implementation of a program was associated with an average reduction of 1.12 opioid-related overdose deaths per 100,000 population in the year after implementation. Additionally, states whose programs had robust characteristics—including monitoring greater numbers of drugs with abuse potential and updating their data at least weekly—had greater reductions in deaths, compared to states whose programs did not have these characteristics. We estimate that if Missouri adopted a prescription drug monitoring program and other states enhanced their programs with robust features, there would be more than 600 fewer overdose deaths nationwide in 2016, preventing approximately two deaths each day.},

We assess the extent to which these new models have influenced the work orientations of frontline staff using three alternative service types—corporate, market, and network—to that proposed by the traditional, procedural model of public bureaucracy. Using surveys of frontline officials in four countries where the revolution in ideas has been accompanied by a revolution in methods for organizing government services, we measure the degree to which the new models are operating as service–delivery norms.

	abstract = {Government managers play a central role in the public administration of countries to support their overall efficiency. The compensation of central government senior managers has received considerable attention in recent years since it has risen in many countries. The public, the media and academia see government senior managers as being overpaid, with salaries increasing in a disproportionate and inequitable way. The literature has analyzed some possible determinants of this socio-administrative issue. However, the political and institutional factors affecting public managers’ compensation are still largely unknown. This study shows that the average compensation of central government senior managers in some OECD countries seems to be positively associated with the average salary of members of parliament (MPs). Furthermore, high compensation of public managers seems to be more frequent in countries with low freedom of expression, of association and of the media, as well as low quality of contract enforcement, property rights and control of corruption. These results may provide fruitful insights into the possible causes of this relation, to support reforms and best practices which can improve the efficiency of the public administration in modern economies.},

However, little is known about how these changes are reflected in the attitudes of private implementing agents: The hybridization literature neglects individuals, and street‐level bureaucracy research has disregarded hybridization. This article extends Hupe and Hill's (
              
              ) accountability regimes framework to introduce the market as an additional accountability regime alongside state, profession, and society. Using a configurational approach, the article explores how public and private food safety inspectors in Switzerland perceive the multiple norms for behavior stemming from their environment. Results suggest that the plural accountabilities of for‐profit street‐level bureaucrats can increase the dilemmas involved in their work. Under certain circumstances, for‐profit street‐level bureaucrats have particular difficulties reconciling rule pressure with market incentives and client demands. The extended accountability regimes framework fruitfully captures such dilemmas and helps identify suitable governance responses.},

In an attempt to build on studies that have gone beyond critiquing the statistical validity and reliability of performance numbers for public services, this article develops two hypotheses about performance enhancement, arguing that (1) the performance‐enhancing (or ‐obstructing) effects of management by numbers will vary according to whether the numbers are used for the purposes of targets, rankings, or “intelligence,” and (2) the performance‐enhancing (or ‐obstructing) effects of those three applications will vary according to the culture in which they operate, working differently in hierarchist, egalitarian, individualist, and fatalist settings.},

In fact, a common feature of most public administrations in the region is, precisely, their internal heterogeneity. The alternation of “fashions and models” has left various (and at times contradictory) organizational remnants: accumulated “geological layers” of different instruments (and modes) of management—replaced by other “prettier and better” ones before concluding their cycle; frustrated and/or interrupted reforms that generate daily confusion as a result of the tensions caused between management systems; and half-implemented regulations patched up with new laws that seek to resolve the failures of the previous ones, causing complex regulatory mosaics for the future implementers of the new reforms. The difficulty of professionalizing the civil service in the region is a good indicator of the (continued) absence of consolidated Weberian administrative bureaucracies and a clear expression of the coexistence of different public administration models and development strategies.},

Under Chavismo-Madurismo, the general objective of the regime was to expand and co-opt all the state institutions, including public administration, to subordinate it to the “revolution” and to gain control over oil revenues. As the central aspect of the paper, we will analyse the strategies of the Chavista governments vis á vis the administration to achieve these goals. We identify three main strategies that were used to sideline the bureaucracy: repression and firing; circumventing and neglecting; and militarisation. With these strategies, Chavismo-Madurismo dismantled the former existing public administration and installed a new administration, loyal to the regime, as a part of the process of autocratization. The paper also addresses how the autocratic regime has (mis)used the public management of the Covid-pandemic to strengthen autocracy under the disguise of a state of emergency.},

Based on a literature review, three hypotheses are formulated regarding citizens' capacity to ease the impact of administrative burdens through behavioral adjustment, use of social and human capital, and strategic behavior. Evidence for these strategies is found in a case study of beneficiaries' behavior in a Mexican social program, where even the most vulnerable citizens have resources to reduce the impact of administrative burdens, even if the actual causes of those burdens remain out of reach. The findings contribute to understanding (a) variance in people's experience of administrative burdens, (b) the impact of prolonged street-level interactions on people's ability to ease administrative burdens, (c) the importance of studying informal street-level interactions, and (d) the relevance of studying state-citizen interactions in developmental contexts.},

	abstract = {Identifying a single model of public administration in Latin America entails a simpliﬁcation due to the variety of countries with different governance structures, administrative systems, historical legacies, and ways of addressing public sector reforms over time. Nevertheless, an extended feature among Latin American public administrations is the coexistence of Weberian models with patrimonialism and large-scale patronage practices. Although at ﬁrst sight public administrations can formally contain all or most of the typical characteristics of a modern bureaucratic system, some of their practices are extraneous to everyday management. In this context, the waves of administrative reforms have sought, with different approaches, to strengthen the public machinery. An important point is that administrative reforms in Latin America largely followed a center–periphery pattern. Firstly, through the imitation of practices of the colonialist countries and later by importing reform packages from the central countries. Thus, this chapter goes over the main historical characteristics in the construction of the Latin American public administration, the reforms paradigms that have marked it and their consequences.},

Evidence submitted by 95 programs administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the PART assessment is analyzed using measures that capture the quality of evidence and methods used by programs and information on characteristics of agencies that might relate to program results and government funding decisions. The study finds that of those programs offering some evidence, most was internal and qualitative, and about half did not assess how their performance compared to other government or private programs with similar objectives. Programs were least likely to provide externally generated evidence of their performance relative to long‐term and annual performance goals. Importantly, overall PART and results scores were (statistically) significantly lower for programs that failed to provide quantitative evidence and did not use long‐term measures, baseline measures or targets, or independent evaluations. Although the PART program results ratings and overall PART scores had no discernible consequences for program funding over time, the PART assessments appeared to take seriously the evaluation of evidence quality, a positive step forward in recent efforts to base policy decisions on more rigorous evidence.},

We find that percentile rank-based measures of intergenerational mobility have remained extremely stable for the 1971-1993 birth cohorts. For children born between 1971 and 1986, we measure intergenerational mobility based on the correlation between parent and child income percentile ranks. For more recent cohorts, we measure mobility as the correlation between a child's probability of attending college and her parents' income rank. We also calculate transition probabilities, such as a child's chances of reaching the top quintile of the income distribution starting from the bottom quintile. Based on all of these measures, we find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s. However, because inequality has risen, the consequences of the “birth lottery” - the parents to whom a child is born - are larger today than in the past.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs for schooling are effective in raising school enrolment and attendance. However, there is also reason to believe that such programs can affect other outcomes, such as the sexual behavior of their young beneﬁciaries. Zomba Cash Transfer Program is a randomized ongoing CCT intervention targeting young women in Malawi that provides incentives (in the form of school fees and cash transfers) to current schoolgirls and recent dropouts to stay in or return to school. An average offer of US\$10/ month conditional on satisfactory school attendance – plus direct payment of secondary school fees – led to signiﬁcant declines in early marriage, teenage pregnancy, and self-reported sexual activity among program beneﬁciaries after just one year of program implementation. For program beneﬁciaries who were out of school at baseline, the probability of getting married and becoming pregnant declined by more than 40 and 30\%, respectively. In addition, the incidence of the onset of sexual activity was 38\% lower among all program beneﬁciaries than the control group. Overall, these results suggest that CCT programs not only serve as useful tools for improving school attendance but may also reduce sexual activity, teen pregnancy, and early marriage.

              Both conditional and unconditional cash transfer programmes increase enrolment compared to no program. But they have at best a small effect on learning outcomes, although the evidence base on learning is small.
              Cash transfers have a larger effect on enrolment if there are conditions that are strictly monitored and enforced. Programs that are explicitly conditional, monitor compliance and penalize non‐compliance have substantively larger effects – increasing the odds of enrolment by 60\% compared to less than 20\% for programs with no conditions.
            
            
              Executive summary
              
                BACKGROUND
                Increasing educational attainment around the world is one of the key aims of the Millennium Development Goals. Cash transfer programs, both conditional and unconditional, are a popular social protection tool in developing countries that aim, among other things, to improve education outcomes in developing countries. The debate over whether these programs should include conditions has been at the forefront of recent global policy discussions. This systematic review aims to complement the existing evidence on the effectiveness of these programs in improving schooling outcomes and help inform the debate surrounding the design of cash transfer programs.
              
              
                OBJECTIVES
                Our main objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of conditional and unconditional cash transfers in improving enrollment, attendance and test scores in developing countries. Our secondary objective was to understand the role of different dimensions of the cash transfer programs, particularly the role of the intensity of conditions and the effects of priming (with respect to the importance of children's schooling) in cash transfer programs.
              
              
                SEARCH STRATEGY
                Five main strategies were used to identify relevant reports: (1) Electronic searches of 37 international databases (concluded on 18 April 2012), (2) contacted researchers working in the area, (3) hand searched key journals, (4) reviewed websites of relevant organizations, and (5) given the year delay between the original search and the final edits of the review we updated our references with all new eligible references the study team was aware of as of 30 April 2013.
              
              
                SELECTION CRITERIA
                To be eligible for this review, studies had to either assess the impact of a conditional cash transfer program (CCT), with at least one condition explicitly related to schooling, or evaluate an unconditional cash transfer program (UCT). The report had to include at least one quantifiable measure of enrollment, attendance or test scores. The report had to be published after 1997, utilize a randomized control trial or a quasi‐experimental design, and take place in a developing country.
              
              
                DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
                A data extraction sheet was constructed to collect data on impacts and characteristics of the report and intervention. Enrollment and attendance were coded using odds ratios, while test scores were coded using standardized mean differences. Effect sizes were synthesized and summarized within and across reports to one effect size per outcome for each study. Given the heterogeneity of true effects in the population, analyses of effect sizes were estimated using random effects models. Moderator analysis was conducted with six additional variables.
              
              
                RESULTS
                The sample includes 75 reports, with data from 35 studies, including five UCTs, 26 CCTs, and four studies that directly compare CCTs to UCTs. Our findings suggest that both CCTs (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.41, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.27–1.56) and UCTs (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.08–1.41) have a significant effect on enrollment. These results indicate that CCTs increase the odds of a child being enrolled in school by 41\% and UCTs increase the odds by 23\%. We do not find a significant difference when comparing CCTs to UCTs (OR 1.15, 95\% CI 0.94–1.42].
                The binary categorization of these programs into CCT vs. UCT ignores the fact that there is a great deal of variation in the intensity of the conditionality. If we instead group the conditionality variable into three broader categories (i) no schooling conditions (intensity=1 or 2), (ii) some schooling conditions with no enforcement or monitoring (intensity=3 or 4) and (iii) explicit schooling conditions monitored and enforced (intensity=5 or 6) we find odds ratios as follows: 1.18 (95\% CI 1.05–1.33), 1.25 (95\% CI 1.10–1.42), and 1.60 (95\% 1.37–1.88), respectively. The 95\% CI for studies with no conditions and studies with conditions monitored and enforced do not overlap. Meta‐regression indicates that outside of the intensity of the conditions imposed, none of the other measured design elements have a significant effect on moderating the overall effect size.
              
              
                AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
                Our main finding is that both CCTs and UCTs improve the odds of being enrolled in and attending school compared to no cash transfer program. The effect sizes for enrollment and attendance are always larger for CCT programs compared to UCT programs but the difference is not significant. When programs are categorized as having no schooling conditions, having some conditions with minimal monitoring and enforcement, and having explicit conditions that are monitored and enforced, a much clearer pattern emerges. While interventions with no conditions or some conditions that are not monitored have some effect on enrollment rates (18–25\% improvement in odds of being enrolled in school), programs that are explicitly conditional, monitor compliance and penalize non‐compliance have substantively larger effects (60\% improvement in odds of enrollment). Unlike enrollment and attendance, the effectiveness of cash transfer programs on improving test scores is small at best. More research is needed that looks at longer term outcomes such as test scores, as well as on evaluating UCTs more generally.},

The authors address this question by testing the link between passive and active representation for race in a police department and in the particular instance of racial profiling. Literature from three areas—racial profiling, representative bureaucracy, and police socialization—is brought together. The findings support the hypothesis that organizational socialization can hinder the link between passive and active representation. Furthermore, the authors find that the presence of black police officers is related to an increase in racial profiling in the division. This finding was unexpected and raises several important questions regarding active representation and race.},

	abstract = {Feminist theory and activism have often been reduced to singular movements from Western literature and history. Thus, the exploration of Feminist theory is often limited to Western ideology and values. In doing so, Western Feminism has primarily promoted the rights of Women living in developed countries while leaving women in developing countries or otherwise out of the discussion of women’s rights and status. Most often, women's rights struggles outside of the West are seen as colonial projects which portray Muslim women as helpless and requiring liberation from their cultures. A prominent example of this is the case of Afghan women under Western occupation and intervention for decades. As viewed by Westerners, the idea of Afghan women's rights is characterized by concerns over burqas and subservient women who do as they are told without question. This thesis aims to demonstrate how critical examination of Western Feminist perspectives is essential for the decolonization of narratives and images of Afghan women as oppressed, subjugated, and without agency. The thesis will also attempt to challenge views of Western Feminism theories and how they compare to postcolonial narratives. By examining postcolonial Feminist criticisms and putting the voices of Afghan women in context, we can decolonize perceptions and feminism(s) of women in Afghanistan.},

In contrast, I argue that the political control of bureaucrats can increase corruption when politicians need money to fund election campaigns and face limited institutional constraints. In such contexts, politicians can leverage their discretionary powers to incentivize bureaucrats to extract rents from the state on politicians’ behalf. Using data from an original survey of bureaucrats (N = 864) across 80 randomly sampled local governments in Ghana, I show that bureaucrats are more likely to facilitate politicians’ corrupt behavior when politicians are perceived to be empowered with higher levels of discretionary control. Using qualitative data and a list experiment to demonstrate the mechanism, I show that politicians enact corruption by threatening to transfer noncompliant officers. My findings provide new evidence on the sources of public administrative deficiencies in developing countries and qualify the presumption that greater political oversight improves governance.},

            This article examines the subnational determinants of descriptive representation. Agency managers may be hesitant to hire women uniformly across all localities if they perceive geographic variation in role congruence, or the degree to which a position's duties match gender roles. We expect managerial perceptions to affect hiring patterns even after the adoption of a gender quota intended to improve descriptive representation, as managers will differentially hire women to meet the quota in localities where they perceive role congruence to be highest. Evidence from Kenya's most important security agency after the adoption of a gender quota supports the theory. Broadly, this article shows that aggregate quotas are at risk of being implemented in a way that undermines the spirit of the law. Slack in oversight pushes implementation to subnational areas where managers perceive the quota will be least disruptive, and ultimately, have the smallest effects on passive, let alone active, representation.},

We provide new evidence on the potential for bottom-up work process innovation, using data from 744 individual and team innovation plans and 51 qualitative interviews in Ghana's civil service. In contrast to common negative stereotypes of developing country bureaucrats, most officials do have meaningful ideas for improving performance. However, the overwhelming constraint to voicing these ideas is hostility by supervisors to new ideas from their subordinates. We argue that this anecdotally common yet understudied behavior is consistent with theories of psychological attachment to hierarchy rather than alternative theories rooted in material, structural, or cultural resistance to employee voice and innovation. We discuss implications for bottom-up work process innovation in government and interventions to promote it.},

While these approaches are appealing to aid donors in their promise to move beyond the limitations of purely formal institution building, they fail to provide new answers to the ‘old’ analytical and practical challenges of public sector reform, in particular administrative patrimonialism, public corruption and political capture. The evidence is yet inchoate, but all points to the need for these approaches to work together with conventional ones. Beyond novel implementation tactics, however, there is a need for new strategies of sustained political support for embattled reformers who face powerful incentives against institutional change.},

They have been further shaped by the injunctions of neoliberalism and conditionalities of donor aid which promote normative northern models of public administration. Recognising this reality African scholars and others have, for some time, advocated for transformative models of policy formulation and governance which more accurately reflect African contexts. Commencing with an analysis of the historical factors that shaped state formation and administrative practices in post-colonial Africa, this article broadly examines how public policy and governance are taught and researched in African institutions. It also reflects on the challenges which confront African academics in developing curricula and in conducting research which is relevant to their national contexts. In so doing, it considers ways in which scholars might retain the essence of key theoretical precepts whilst adapting them to local contexts. It also argues for a stronger pan-African focus in the development of teaching materials and in conducting research which traverses linguistic and geographic boundaries.},

There was no evidence of a unique impact from the percentage of female headed families in each city, or the study’s other independent variables, on the gender poverty gap, with the exception of their contribution through the proportion of females in the lowest wage occupations. This study provides empirical support for the likely ineffectiveness of TANF initiatives promoting employment and marriage for alleviating female poverty. In addition, the study found important non-random geographic variations in the difference between cities with the highest and lowest gender disparity in poverty rates. Only one of the ten US cities with the highest rankings in gender poverty disparity is located west of the Mississippi River.},

	abstract = {In spite of the traditional legitimacy accorded the market mechanism of the private sector in advanced capitalist nations, governments in those nations have become more influential as providers of social services and income supplements, producers of goods, managers of the economy, and investors of capital. And in order to finance these various activities the revenues of public authorities have increased dramatically–to a point where they are now equivalent to one-third to one-half of a nation's economic product.
            This growth in governmental activity in advanced capitalist society is examined by considering the causes, and some of the consequences, of the expansion of the public economy–defined, following Schumpeter's discussion of the “tax state,” in terms of the extractive role of government. The primary concern of this article is to discover why some nations have experienced a far greater rate of increase in recent years and, as a result, have a much larger public economy than other nations. Five types of explanation are elaborated to account for the growth of the scope of governmental activity: (1) the level and rate of growth in the economic product; (2) the degree to which the fiscal structure of a nation relies on indirect, or “invisible,” taxes; (3) politics–in particular the partisan composition of government and the frequency of electoral competition; (4) the institutional structure of government; and (5) the degree of exposure of the economy to the international marketplace. The article evaluates the five explanations with data for 18 nations, and concludes by discussing some implications of the analysis.},

We explore the social spending consequences of government partisanship, electoral competition and turnout, and the self-interested behaviors of politicians and bureaucrats, as well as such relatively durable facets of political institutions as neocorporatism, state centralization, and traditionalist policy legacies. Pooled time series analyses of welfare effort in 18 nations during the 1960–82 period show that electoral turnout, as well as left and center governments increase welfare effort; that the welfare efforts of governments led by particular types of parties show significant differences and vary notably with the strength of oppositional (and junior coalitional) parties; and that relatively neocorporatist, centralized, and traditionalistic polities are high on welfare effort. Overall, our findings suggest that contrary to many claims, both partisan and nonpartisan facets of democratic politics and political institutions shape contemporary social welfare effort.},

In this paper, we argue that there is an under-theorized link in the micro-foundations for PRT, namely why wage earners trying to cope with social risks and demand for redistribution would turn to the state for a solution. Our approach, the Quality of Government (QoG) theory, stresses the importance of trustworthy, impartial, and uncorrupted government institutions as a precondition for citizens’ willingness to support policies for social insurance. Drawing on data on 18 OECD countries during 1984–2000, we find (a) that QoG positively affects the size and generosity of the welfare state, and (b) that the effect of working class mobilization on welfare state generosity increases with the level of QoG.},

However, doubts have been raised as regards to the robustness of these findings. In this article we document that agency officials pay significantly less attention to signals from executive politicians than their counterparts within ministerial (cabinet‐level) departments. This finding holds when we control for variation in tasks, the political salience of issue areas, and officials' rank. Simultaneously we observe that the three control variables all have an independent effect on officials' attentiveness to a steer from above. In addition we find that the more organizational capacity available within the respective ministerial departments, the more agency personnel tend to assign weight to signals from the political leadership. We apply large‐N questionnaire data at three points in time, spanning two decades and shifting administrative doctrines.},

	abstract = {As a self-conscious discipline among the cluster of specialties or “fields” encompassed by political science, public administration came late and grew fast. Its recent arrival and rapid growth sometimes obscure the fact that its origins are to be found in a process of experimentation with governmental structure that long preceded the appearance of public administration as a subject of systematic study and is likely to continue as long as the nation exists. This process of experimentation goes on vigorously today, and the development of new forms is generating discord more profound and far-reaching than any that has ever hitherto divided students of public administration. It is with the sources and significance of that discord that this paper is concerned.
            The central thesis of this paper is that an examination of the administrative institutions of this country suggests that they have been organized and operated in pursuit successively of three values, here designated representativeness, neutral competence, and executive leadership.},

While both views have merit, they miss important but little‐recognized dynamics of Chinese bureaucratic behavior. Examination of the 30‐year evolution of a single organization, China's 863 Program, allows us a unique look inside the “black box” of decision making. First, we highlight a largely unrecognized mechanism of top‐down control: a signal‐response process that fosters substantial uncertainty for officials in the system. Second, our case highlights a circumstance in which reformers made radical moves—deployed as a “band‐aid” layer of rational‐instrumentalism—to meet a perceived external security threat. These moves demonstrate efforts to incorporate Weberian norms, and suggest sources of dynamism and learning in a “hybrid adaptive” bureaucracy.},

This article investigates how state capacity, a country's fundamental ability to organize bureaucracy and allocate societal resources, affects the timing and configuration of governments' COVID19 policy responses. Through comparative case study analysis of five of China's neighboring countries early in the COVID-19 crisis, the paper shows that more-capable states (Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan) initiated crisis response faster, mobilized national resources more extensively, and utilized diverse policy tools when the virus risk level was still low. In contrast, low-capacity states (Thailand and Indonesia) were more reactive in handling the crisis, limited their focus to border-related measures, and were more constrained in the types of tools they could employ. The paper points to the importance of studying the COVID-19 response process rather than the outcome (i.e., confirmed cases/deaths) when unpacking the impacts of political institutions in public health crises.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes the political-institutional determinants of bureaucracy quality among a group of newly industrialized countries in Latin America and East Asia democratized in the Third Wave. Four causal conditions are examined for the occurrence of higher levels of bureaucratic “weberianess” in the selected cases: historical sequence, political parties' institutionalization, electoral competition, and ethnic politics. The study employs the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to explore the expectation that each of these conditions' implications depends on other conditions' presence or absence. The findings disconfirm claims about the critical role of party system institutionalization for Weberian bureaucracies in new democracies. Besides, the analysis did not declare a professional public administration's prior existence before democratization as a necessary or sufficient condition for the outcome of interest. Finally, although the electoral competition was declared necessary for the outcome occurrence, it does not imply the same result if combined with ethnic politics.},

Despite its many achievements, public administration has its problems, generally the product of conflicts between tradition and modernity. Due emphasis should, however, be given to addressing the challenges of its over-politicization, strengthening governance practices, enhancing the human factor, and instituting further modern administrative reforms.},

It begins as a fragile state, consolidating to becoming a vibrant state, only to embark, eventually, on a downward trajectory through phases of rigidity, decaying, and fragility, before becoming a failed state. About one-third of MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries are either fragile or failed states. Only technological change and knowledge accumulation and diffusion can shift this curve upward, thereby increasing a state’s effective governance capacity.},

Then, using data from the newly-developed Arab Administrative Elites Survey, it taps into the images and aspirations of public governance insiders as regards crucial public sector values. According to this data, the reforms aim to increase efficiency and to bring public administrations closer to the people. Arguably, reforms in MENA public governance converge, though from a relatively low level, with the direction of global standards of public management.},

Inspired by Mancur Olson's insight into elite incentives and governance, we examine how the Chinese practices of elite management affect the character of governance using unique survey and interview data on township leaders and social contention. We find that, first, externally appointed party secretaries experience more petitions and mass incidents during their tenure and are more likely to use coercion to deal with petitions than internally appointed secretaries. Second, these tendencies are moderated when externally appointed party secretaries are paired with internally appointed township heads We explore the implications of such behavioral differences and suggest our findings are of broad significance for understanding governance in China.},

	abstract = {Credible, reliable and consistent information to the public, as well as health professionals and decision makers, is crucial to help navigate uncertainty and risk in times of crisis and concern. Traditionally, information and health communications issued by respected and established government agencies have been regarded as factual, unbiased and credible. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is such an agency that addresses all aspects of health and public health on behalf of the U.S Government for the benefit of its citizens. In July 2020, the CDC issued guidelines on reopening schools which resulted in open criticism by the U.S. President and others, prompting a review and publication of revised guidelines together with a special “Statement on the Importance of Reopening Schools under COVID-19.” We hypothesize that this statement introduced bias with the intention to shift the public perception and media narrative in favor of reopening of schools. Using a mixed methods approach, including an online text analysis tool, we demonstrate that document title and structure, word frequencies, word choice, and website presentation did not provide a balanced account of the complexity and uncertainty surrounding school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite available scientific guidance and practical evidence-based advice on how to manage infection risks when reopening schools, the CDC Statement was intentionally overriding possible parent and public health concerns. The CDC Statement provides an example of how political influence is exercised over the presentation of science in the context of a major pandemic. It was withdrawn by the CDC in November 2020.},

In one of the most poignant examples of housing as a social determinant of health, the COVID-19 pandemic amplified the link between an individual’s housing instability and community-wide health. “Housing is health” became the justification for halting the eviction system: Policymakers nationwide adopted moratoria, eviction protections, emergency rental assistance, and other housing supports with the goal of protecting community-wide health. These robust measures resulted in unprecedented low eviction filing rates and extensive benefits to individual and public health. Today, with the lapse of pandemic interventions, the eviction crisis is reemerging as a pervasive threat to public health. Eviction filing rates have returned to or surpassed historical averages in jurisdictions across the United States. Policymakers across the country are called to address the eviction system as an urgent public health priority.},

	shorttitle = {Red hot city},
	abstract = {"A growth-above-all development ethos permeates the Atlanta region and is rooted in the city's twentieth-century expansion. Like some other booming Sunbelt metros, Atlanta has combined a continuing reliance on public-private partnerships and a state and regional planning and policy regime that excessively caters to capital, often at the expense of its poorer residents, who are predominantly Black and Latinx. As the city proper has become a hot commodity in the real estate arena and is no longer majority-Black, the region has inverted the late twentieth-century poor-in-the-core urban model to one where less affluent families face exclusion from the central city and more affluent suburbs and are pushed out to lower-income, sometimes quite distant suburbs, usually farther from mass transit, large public hospitals, and other essential services. At this writing, the Atlanta metropolitan area is the ninth-largest in the country and likely to climb into the eighth spot in the not-to-distant future. This book focuses on four key, interconnected themes in the evolution and restructuring of Atlanta in the twenty-first century. The first is the major racial and economic restructuring of the region's residential geography, including the city proper. A second theme of the book is the failure of the City of Atlanta to capture a significant share of a tremendous growth in local land values. A third theme of the book is the critical role of state government in constraining and enabling how development and redevelopment occurs and whether the interests of those most vulnerable to exclusion and displacement are given serious consideration. The final theme of the book, and its key overarching narrative, concerns the political economy of urban change and the presence of inflection points. These are periods during which particularly consequential policy decisions are made that have a disproportionate impact on the trajectories of a place and direct and long-lasting implications for racial and economic exclusion. The book's conclusion ties together many of the lessons from these chapters. It ends with discussing what recent political trends could mean for the development trajectory of, and continued exclusion in, the region. It also calls for avoiding a "market-inevitability" fatalism that suggests that nothing can be done to redirect or alter the sorts of trajectories described in the book. It reminds the reader that the events and consequences described are not simply the result of apolitical, atomistic market forces, but is shaped heavily by institutional actors and processes"--},

How may the democratic rule of law ( état de droit, estado democrático de derecho, Rechsstaat ) be conceptualized and, insofar as possible, empirically gauged? By exploring a set of variables within the rule of law we can understand what makes it effective and how it relates to other aspects of the performance of democratic countries. This essay focuses on contemporary Latin America (especially Argentina and Brazil) where national-level democratic regimes often effectively coexist with undemocratic sub-national regimes—so-called “brown areas.”},

How We Help
The City of Atlanta recognizes that there are times when families and individuals face financial hardships and need help paying for essential services like water. The City offers financial assistance to low to moderate income ratepayers who are having difficulty paying water and sewer bills through an innovative program called Care \& Conserve.

The Care \& Conserve program takes the further step of helping these ratepayers prevent future high bills by providing assistance with plumbing problems and with the installation of water efficiency devices. Care and Conserve benefits all customers of the Department of Watershed Management by helping to reduce the burden of outstanding debt on the system and by promoting the most efficient use of our water resources.

            Secure water access is a fundamental human right. Our study reveals disparities in piped water access in urban areas in the United States. From 2013 to 2017, we find that an estimated 1,121,100 people (±25,500) in the United States had insecure water access, with nearly one-half (47\%) located in the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Unplumbed households in cities, on balance, are more likely to be headed by people of color, earn lower incomes, live in mobile homes, rent their residence, and pay a higher share of their gross income toward housing costs. We offer clear evidence that gaps in urban water access are neither random nor accidental but underpinned by precarious housing conditions and systemic social and racialized inequality.
          , 
            Safe, reliable, and equitable water access is critical to human health and livelihoods. In the United States, an estimated 471,000 households or 1.1 million individuals lack a piped water connection and 73\% of households are located in cities, close to networked supply. In this study, we undertake a nationwide analysis of urban water access in the United States, with the aim of explaining the drivers of infrastructural inequality in the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Drawing on statistical analysis and regression modeling of census microdata at the household scale, our analysis reveals spatial and sociodemographic patterns of racialized, class-based, and housing disparities that characterize plumbing poverty. Among unplumbed households, we show that households headed by people of color are almost 35\% more likely to lack piped water as compared to white, non-Hispanic households. Precarious housing conditions are an equally strong predictor: Renter-occupied households in the 50 largest US metros were 1.61 times more likely than owner-occupied households to lack piped water. We argue that insecure domestic water access in the United States should be understood as a housing issue that reflects structural inequalities of race and class, particularly in cities with widening wealth gaps. The article concludes with a call for research and action at the intersection of water provision, housing, and social inequality—a paradigm we call the housing–water nexus.},

We collect 438 Connections games to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) against expert and novice human players. Our results show that even the best performing LLM, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which has otherwise shown impressive reasoning abilities on a wide variety of benchmarks, can only fully solve 18\% of the games. Novice and expert players perform better than Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with expert human players significantly outperforming it. We create a taxonomy of the knowledge types required to successfully cluster and categorize words in the Connections game. We find that while LLMs perform relatively well on categorizing words based on semantic relations they struggle with other types of knowledge such as Encyclopedic Knowledge, Multiword Expressions or knowledge that combines both Word Form and Meaning.

	abstract = {In recent decades, authorities have adopted a number of programs that tether the criminal and immigration enforcement apparatuses in novel ways. This mixed methods case study assesses the impact of such programs on local criminal justice processes and outcomes in King County, Washington. Although the empirical research on the effects of such programs is scant, the emerging literature on legal hybridity suggests that the enmeshment of the criminal and immigration systems is likely to enhance the state's power to detain and punish. The quantitative results support this hypothesis: non-citizens flagged by immigration authorities stay in jail significantly longer than their similarly situated counterparts. Qualitative focus group interviews with prosecuting and defense attorneys identify four key mechanisms by which Immigration Customs and Enforcement detainers alter the incentive structure, impact decisionmaking, and extend jail stays for non-citizens. Together, these findings suggest that immigration law and the threat of deportation now cast a long shadow over local as well as federal criminal proceedings, and enhance penal pain for non-citizens. Implications of these findings for the “crimmigration” literature and research on the effect of citizenship status on criminal justice outcomes are discussed.},

	abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: In light of recent debate over upzonings and leveraging markets as means of expanding housing opportunity, I review the evolution of exclusionary zoning practices in the United States and provide an intellectual history of scholars’ research into these practices. In the context of early 20th-century racial and class tension, American elites coveted the ability to use the states’ police powers to sort out cities by housing type and gained this ability with legislative and judicial support for local land use zoning schemes that controlled residential densities and building forms. Many 20th-century U.S. planners upheld the resulting socially sorted city as an ideal outcome of good zoning practice. But in the postwar decades, a new breed of equity-focused advocacy planner sought to address racial ghettoization by using zoning reforms and other measures to open exclusive areas to low- and moderate-income housing. Wider shifts in housing policy since the 1970s and the increasing attention of economic scholarship to the myriad impacts of American zoning practices have, however, diluted the original equity-focused agenda of exclusionary zoning scholarship. Takeaway for practice: Given the need for a common effort against business-as-usual zoning in the United States, planners can assert the ethics of the planning profession in debates about American zoning practices. Scholarly and professional efforts to dismantle exclusionary zoning can return to their roots in housing advocacy, becoming one part of a multipronged agenda aimed at expanding housing opportunity by a variety of means.},

I develop a framework to explain links—sometimes contradictory—between upzonings and construction, prices, and demographics.

Evidence indicates that upzonings offer mixed success in terms of housing production, reduced costs, and social integration in impacted neighborhoods; outcomes depend on market demand, local context, housing types, and timing. Research on regional upzoning impacts is nascent but outcomes appear positive. Downzonings limit construction and worsen affordability.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

This has gone as far as some journals banning the use of indicators for statistical significance, or even any reports of p-values, and, in one case, any mention of confidence intervals. I discuss three of the issues that have led to these often-heated debates. First, I argue that in many cases, p-values and indicators of statistical significance do not answer the questions of primary interest. Such questions typically involve making (recommendations on) decisions under uncertainty. In that case, point estimates and measures of uncertainty in the form of confidence intervals or even better, Bayesian intervals, are often more informative summary statistics. In fact, in that case, the presence or absence of statistical significance is essentially irrelevant, and including them in the discussion may confuse the matter at hand. Second, I argue that there are also cases where testing null hypotheses is a natural goal and where p-values are reasonable and appropriate summary statistics. I conclude that banning them in general is counterproductive. Third, I discuss that the overemphasis in empirical work on statistical significance has led to abuse of p-values in the form of p-hacking and publication bias. The use of pre-analysis plans and replication studies, in combination with lowering the emphasis on statistical significance may help address these problems.},

Each of the four datasets is generated based on a distinct causal mechanism: the first involves a collider, the second involves a confounder, the third involves a mediator, and the fourth involves the induction of M-Bias by an included factor. The article includes a mathematical summary of each dataset, as well as directed acyclic graphs that depict the relationships between the variables. Despite the fact that the statistical summaries and visualizations for each dataset are identical, the true causal effect differs, and estimating it correctly requires knowledge of the datagenerating mechanism. These example datasets can help practitioners gain a better understanding of the assumptions underlying causal inference methods and emphasize the importance of gathering more information beyond what can be obtained from statistical tools alone. The article also includes R code for reproducing all figures and provides access to the datasets themselves through an R package named “quartets.” Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {A goal of many research programmes in biology is to extract meaningful insights from large, complex datasets. Researchers in ecology, evolution and behavior (EEB) often grapple with long-term, observational datasets from which they construct models to test causal hypotheses about biological processes. Similarly, epidemiologists analyse large, complex observational datasets to understand the distribution and determinants of human health. A key difference in the analytical workflows for these two distinct areas of biology is the delineation of data analysis tasks and explicit use of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), widely adopted by epidemiologists. Here, we review the most recent causal inference literature and describe an analytical workflow that has direct applications for EEB. We start this commentary by defining four distinct analytical tasks (description, prediction, association, causal inference). The remainder of the text is dedicated to causal inference, specifically focusing on the use of DAGs to inform the modelling strategy. Given the increasing interest in causal inference and misperceptions regarding this task, we seek to facilitate an exchange of ideas between disciplinary silos and provide an analytical framework that is particularly relevant for making causal inference from observational data.},

Probit models are also estimated for the probability that a child is enrolled, controlling for additional characteristics of the child, their parents, local schools, and community, and for sample attrition, to evaluate the sensitivity of the program estimates. These estimates of program short-run effects on enrollment are extrapolated to the lifetime schooling and the earnings of adults to approximate the internal rate of return on the public schooling subsidies as they increase expected private wages.},

	abstract = {Objective: To identify features of the Philadelphia SSB tax policymaking process that contributed to the proposal’s passage. Design: Qualitative case study. Semistructured interviews were conducted with key informants closely involved with the policymaking process. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Local news media about the SSB tax proposal were analyzed to triangulate interview findings. Analysis was conducted in NVivo 10 using inductive qualitative content analysis. Setting: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the SSB tax policymaking in process. Participants: Nine key informants (2 city councilpersons, 4 city agency officials, 1 community-based advocate, 1 news reporter, and 1 researcher).
Results: The Philadelphia SSB tax proposal was introduced with the explicit goal of financing universal prekindergarten and deliberately not framed as a health intervention. This framing shifted contentious debates about government involvement in individual behavior toward discussions about how to finance universal prekindergarten, a goal for which broad support existed. The LHD played an important role in communicating research evidence about potential health benefits of the SSB tax proposal at the end of the policymaking process.
Conclusions: During local SSB tax policy development processes, LHD officials and other advocates should encourage policymakers to design SSB tax policies so that revenue is directed toward community investments for which broad public support exists. When communicating with policymakers and the public, LHDs should consider emphasizing how SSB tax revenue will be used in addition to presenting evidence about the potential health benefits of the SSB tax at the local level.},

	abstract = {Objective
To examine the cost and cost-effectiveness of implementing Students for Nutrition and eXercise (SNaX), a 5-week middle-school-based obesity-prevention intervention combining school-wide environmental changes, multimedia, encouragement to eat healthy school cafeteria foods, and peer-led education.

Methods
Five intervention and five control middle schools (mean enrollment = 1,520 students) from the Los Angeles Unified School District participated in a randomized controlled trial of SNaX. Acquisition costs for materials and time and wage data for employees involved in implementing the program were used to estimate fixed and variable costs. Cost-effectiveness was determined using the ratio of variable costs to program efficacy outcomes.

Results
The costs of implementing the program over 5 weeks were \$5,433.26 per school in fixed costs and \$2.11 per student in variable costs, equaling a total cost of \$8,637.17 per school, or \$0.23 per student per day. This investment yielded significant increases in the proportion of students served fruit and lunch and a significant decrease in the proportion of students buying snacks. The cost-effectiveness of the program, per student over 5 weeks, was \$1.20 per additional fruit served during meals, \$8.43 per additional full-priced lunch served, \$2.11 per additional reduced-price/free lunch served, and \$1.69 per reduction in snacks sold.

Conclusions
SNaX demonstrated the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a middle-school-based obesity-prevention intervention combining school-wide environmental changes, multimedia, encouragement to eat healthy school cafeteria foods, and peer-led education. Its cost is modest and unlikely to be a significant barrier to adoption for many schools considering its implementation.},

            This paper explores the relationship between public housing, health outcomes, and health behaviors among low‐income housing residents. While public housing can be a dangerous and unhealthy environment in which to live, the subsidized rent may free up resources for nutritious food and health care. In addition, public housing may be of higher quality than the available alternatives, it may provide easier access to health clinics willing to serve the poor, and it may link residents to social support networks, which can improve mental health and the ability to access higher‐quality grocery stores. To test whether there is a “back‐door” health benefit to the public housing program, we analyze data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. We minimize the effects of selection into public housing with controls and instrumental variables estimation and find that the results are somewhat sensitive to the instrumental variable used, and thus, we conclude that we are unable to detect a robust health benefit from public housing for our measures of health. However, we do find some evidence that public housing residency has mixed effects on domestic violence, increases obesity, and worsens mothers' overall health status. © 2007 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management},

	abstract = {Homeowners face risk due to variation in annual property tax liabilities, which may result in financial distress and eventual mortgage foreclosure. By reducing the pro-cyclicality of property tax liabilities, we show that property tax limitations can expose households to greater systematic risk despite reducing intertemporal variation in tax amounts overall. We develop an innovative measure of tax policy risk using Arrow-Debreu securities and obtain simulated measures of risk that capture all of the key characteristics of states’ property tax regimes. Using a state border discontinuity design and parcel-level data for the universe of U.S. residential properties, we show that a one standard deviation increase in tax policy risk (≈ \$200) increases the probability of mortgage distress by approximately 0.19 percentage points. The magnitude of this unintended effect is comparable to the increase in probability of mortgage distress associated with owning a home in disrepair and is approximately one eighth as large as the effect of moving between the third and fourth quartiles of the loan-to-value distribution (near the threshold for being underwater).},

	abstract = {Since 1965, 30 states and the District of Columbia have enacted programs designed to reduce the effective rate of property taxation for some low income households and for the elderly. Most often this relief is provided by so-called "circuit-breakers." It is contended that the economic arguments favoring circuit-breakers are empirically unproven and theoretically suspect. The tax may be progressive, not regressive, and the device may transfer income from low to high income households. Any short run redistribution of income to favor the poor or the elderly would, in the long run, merely shift the timing of their tax payments. Circuit-breakers encourage over-consumption of housing and misallocation of housing resources. Reducing the tax base, they produce higher rates and so increase the tax burden.},

	abstract = {Property tax circuit-breaker programs-provision for tax relief for selected groups of the population believed to be adversely affected by rising state and local taxation on residences-exist in 30 states and the District of Columbia. They are still in controversy. The best available evidence on some of the basic issues being debated is considered in an effort to evaluate their policy implications. The device is found to be desirable and, if the residential property tax were regressive in certain respects, a move in the direction of tax equity. "Current income" is found more useful in determining eligibility; net worth tests would be difficult to apply. Relief for tax burdens above an acceptable share of household income is preferable to one based on a sliding scale formula. However, the tendency clearly is to liberalize benefits. This creates the danger of eroding the tax base.},
